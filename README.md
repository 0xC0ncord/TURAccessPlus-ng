Building AccessPlus
=================
In order to build AccessPlus you will have to download the source code (https://github.com/EliotVU/UT2004-AccessPlus/archive/master.zip) and save it in your UT2004's main folder, for example in: "C:\UT2004\".
Once done (it is recommended that you rename UT2004-AccessPlus-master to AccessPlus), you are safe to execute the Make.bat file, the engine will compile the project and if everything was setup right it should compile without any errors.
